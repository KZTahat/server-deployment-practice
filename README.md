# server-deployment-practice

## notes
in this server practice, I created a server using express framework in `server.js` file and implemented all the endpoints required in this lab ('/', '/data', '/bad') plus the error handlers for not found end points and the internal error server located at handlers directory, in addtion to the `__tests__` folder to have the tests for server.js file along with all the functionalities included. And I have the server listining at index.js file.

- dependencies installed : 
    1. express.
    2. dotenv.
    3. jest.
    4. supertest.
    5. nodemon.
